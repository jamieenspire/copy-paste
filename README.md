## Purpose of Annual Enrollment

Annual enrollment is the one time each year employees can change their benefits choices. It also gives you the opportunity to review the updates and changes in the upcoming years benefits coverage.
 
### Enrollment Resources:
1. The Benefits Department is available to talk about the changes and how the benefits work

2. Review the benefits guide and each individual benefit on your NEW benefits app
